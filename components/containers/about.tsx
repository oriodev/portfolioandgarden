        i started off with <strong>cs50</strong> and <strong>the odin project</strong>, 
        teaching myself how to code from
        my bedroom. i was a <strong>liberal arts & natural sciences</strong> student by day (read: i studied
        a confusing combination of modules from all over the university) and a self-taught coder by night.
        over time, i was allowed to take more computer science modules at university and i landed a <strong>frontend internship at todaytix group</strong> in
        london. i swapped out a boring dissertation for the <strong>computer science final year project</strong>, 
        taught myself <strong>java</strong>, got really good at <strong>full stack development</strong>, and now i&apos;m looking for my
        next steps into the professional world of software development.
